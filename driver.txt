Creating a 5x5 board with a default number of snakes and ladders (1/4 of the size):

START => 1 (Player 1) (Player 2) => 2 => 3 (Ladder to: 23) => 4 => 5 => 6 => 7 (Ladder to: 19) => 8 => 9 => 10 => 11 (Ladder to: 15) => 12 => 13 => 14 => 15 => 16 => 17 (Snake to: 9) => 18 => 19 => 20 => 21 (Snake to: 5) => 22 => 23 => 24 => 25 => END

Player 1 gets a 3, and player 2 gets a 6:

START => 1 => 2 => 3 (Ladder to: 23) => 4 (Player 1) => 5 => 6 => 7 (Ladder to: 19) => 8 => 9 => 10 => 11 (Ladder to: 15) => 12 => 13 => 14 => 15 => 16 => 17 (Snake to: 9) => 18 => 19 (Player 2) => 20 => 21 (Snake to: 5) => 22 => 23 => 24 => 25 => END
